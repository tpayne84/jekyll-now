If you are like me, every problem in your day-to-day seems more like a potential opportunity for you to create a solution ( or at least a better mouse trap ).  However until now, I haven't taken the time to develop any of these ideas into more than a simple proof of concept.  But, I have finally decided to make the time and put forth the effort to begin developing some of my solutions for common and some less common problems into working productized solutions.

But the question for many ( at least it has been for me ), is where to start?

1.) Think of a clever name ( preferably one that has a domain name available ).

2.) Purchase said domain and setup any initial settings / services that you may need; mail hosting, web hosting, etc...

3.) Begin development on a proof of concept, because at the end of the day if you do not have a functional solution to whatever problem it is that you are trying to solve, you have nothing.


Obviously, this is just to get you started... But that is what this post is about, where to start.

I invite you to join me on this journey from an idea to a productized web application, as I will be writing more posts as I take additional steps toward a release of an idea I am developing into a web app.
